# GenAI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot

[cite_start]This project is a demonstration of a Generative AI-powered chatbot for customer support automation, based on my professional experience developing and deploying similar solutions[cite: 44]. [cite_start]The bot is designed to handle user queries, integrate with enterprise workflows, and reduce manual intervention[cite: 44, 45].

### Key Features
* [cite_start]**LLM Integration:** Utilizes Large Language Models like GPT-4 to understand and respond to user queries in natural language[cite: 45].
* [cite_start]**Conversational Workflows:** Built with a framework like LangChain to orchestrate complex, multi-turn conversational flows[cite: 48].
* [cite_start]**Function Calling:** Demonstrates the ability to trigger external tools or business logic workflows through natural language input[cite: 64].
* [cite_start]**Contextual Memory:** Employs contextual memory to maintain conversation state and provide coherent, relevant responses[cite: 49].

### Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Programming:** Python [cite: 38]
* [cite_start]**Generative AI:** OpenAI API (GPT-4), LangChain [cite: 38]
* [cite_start]**Deployment:** FastAPI, Docker (for containerization) [cite: 38]

### To-Do / Future Enhancements
- [ ] Integrate a vector database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- [ ] Develop a simple front-end using Streamlit or Gradio.
- [ ] [cite_start]Add a framework for evaluating the quality of GenAI outputs[cite: 65].
