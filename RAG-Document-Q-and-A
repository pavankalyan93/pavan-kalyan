# RAG Pipeline for Contextual Document Q&A

[cite_start]This project showcases a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, designed for contextual question-and-answering on custom documents[cite: 57]. This system minimizes model hallucination by grounding the LLM's responses in factual knowledge retrieved from a specialized vector database.

### Key Features
* [cite_start]**Document Processing:** Ingests and processes large documents (e.g., PDFs, reports) for analysis[cite: 60].
* **Vector Embeddings:** Uses embedding models to convert text chunks into vector representations.
* [cite_start]**Vector Database:** Implements a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone) for efficient similarity search and retrieval[cite: 57].
* [cite_start]**LLM Integration:** Leverages LangChain to combine the retrieved context with a prompt and an LLM (like GPT-4) to generate a factual, context-aware answer[cite: 54].

### Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Programming:** Python [cite: 38]
* [cite_start]**Generative AI:** LangChain, RAG, Hugging Face Transformers (for embeddings), Vector DB (FAISS) [cite: 38]
* [cite_start]**Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy [cite: 38]

### To-Do / Future Enhancements
- [ ] Build a user interface to upload documents and ask questions.
- [ ] Experiment with different embedding models and chunking strategies.
- [ ] [cite_start]Implement a real-time pipeline with streaming data platforms like Kafka[cite: 21].
